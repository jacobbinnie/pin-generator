### Coding Challenge Guidelines

Had a bit of fun with this one. The script returns x number of 4-digit pins that the user sets in the requestedAmount variable. It abides by the following criteria ~

- The library should export a function that returns a batch of 1,000 PIN codes in random order
- Each PIN code in the batch should be unique
<br/>
Each PIN should be:
<br/>
4 digits long
<br/>
Two consecutive digits should not be the same (e.g. 1156 is invalid)
<br/>
Three consecutive digits should not be incremental (e.g. 1236 is invalid)
<br/>
The library should have automated tests.
